# About Me🍐🐋🌺

I am a current computer science student at Rutgers New Brunswick interested in growing my knowledge of languages and their capabilities. I am familiar with Java, HTML, and CSS, and am currently diving into Python and JavaScript. I am a member of the Douglass WiSE CSLLC and I am always looking to grow the community of women in computer science around me.
